Historically, internships have served as a smooth transition into the workforce for college students looking to gain additional experience, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/covid19.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">COVID-19<\/a> crisis means there are limited opportunities. According to our economic research team, we\u2019ve seen<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/research\/job-market-report-april-14\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> job openings on Glassdoor<\/a> drop to 4.8 million as of April 6,\u00a0 a 20.5 percent decline in openings since March 9. However, online internship job openings on Glassdoor dropped to 30,806 as of April 13, a 52 percent drop since March 9. One in two internship openings have been closed since the coronavirus crisis began in the United States, and intern hiring in April has fallen 39 percent compared to last April.<\/p><p>Although these data points seem bleak, there are still thousands of opportunities available for those on the hunt for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Job\/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&clickSource=searchBtn&typedKeyword=Internship&locT=&locId=&jobType=&context=Jobs&sc.keyword=Internship&dropdown=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">internship.<\/a> Companies are transitioning from on-site positions to virtual ones to accommodate the influx of college graduates and college students seeking internships. Our research shows that manufacturing, accounting & legal, and computer software & hardware are the industries with the most internship openings available now, demonstrating that select sectors are continuing to hire for thousands of intern positions amid multiple declines within other verticals.\u00a0 If you\u2019re a student in your final year of university or college searching for an internship, please find several tips below to help you guide your search.<\/p><p><b>1. Do thorough research and planning.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>When beginning your internship search, first determine what your passion points are and then identify companies that are aligned with them. In addition to making an active list of companies that fit your interests and passion, figure out what you prioritize as part of your work experience, i.e., good pay, growth opportunities, mentorship, work-life balance. In this climate, it\u2019s crucial for you to be open to diverse opportunities like post-grad internships, contract, remote, and freelance work. Once you have your internship search priorities, industries in-demand for talent, and companies identified, set up internship alerts for select companies to get customized internship recommendations sent to you.\u00a0<\/p><p>Glassdoor\u2019s mobile app offers a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/how-to-use-collections\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> collections tool<\/a> where you can gather a wide range of data to help you organize your search and help you prepare for the internship interview, salary negotiation, and the final offer acceptance. Remember to reference our robust offerings of career advice and tips on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/covid-19-response\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glassdoor blog<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic research site <\/a>to help keep you informed and get noticed by recruiters.<\/p><p><b>2. Create a timeline for your search.<\/b><\/p><p>If you are currently unemployed and actively looking for a role or internship, you likely feel a sense of urgency. To keep your sanity, set a timeline for when you\u2019d like to get your internship locked in. Identifying short term goals will help you gain a sense of control of your situation and will provide you with structure.<\/p><p><b>3. Leverage your college\u2019s and\/or university\u2019s career services.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>Now more than ever, it\u2019s important to lean into your college\u2019s career services program to gain additional internship search assistance. Aim to get yourself connected to a career advisor\/counselor to leverage other resources and to develop an internship search game plan. College career services should also have access to resume and cover letter workshops, virtual networking events, virtual career panels featuring accomplished alumni, as well as information about virtual career\/internship fairs.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>4. Create or revamp your resume, cover letter, and online profiles.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>Take the time to create or revamp your resume and online profiles to highlight your current career accomplishments, education, passions, and skills. Lean into developing your brand to give employers a sense of your narrative and mission, which will differentiate you from many applicants. Cover letters are critical to speak directly to the recruiter \u2013 this is your best chance to get noticed, so make sure to take the proper time to produce a great<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/guide\/how-to-write-a-cover-letter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> cover letter.<\/a> When applying for remote internships, read the position description carefully to showcase the specific skills that match the description.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>5. Stand out with customized materials.<\/b><\/p><p>Now isn\u2019t the time to submit a generic resume and cover letter to each internship position you come across. Set yourself apart from the rest of the applicant pool by being creative and intentional on how you market yourself to prospective employers. Candidates need to tailor their materials and message as to why they're a good fit and why they're interested in that particular opportunity. Make sure your resume and online presence highlight relevant experience, education, passions, and skills. Plus, providing application materials that are specifically tailored to each opportunity will help yours stand out in a stack of resumes.<\/p><p><b>6. Develop connections with your networks online.<\/b><\/p><p>Tap into your networks that might include friends, professional mentors, and college alumni to see if they know anyone hiring or organizations with open roles. Seek out professionals that you admire online to spark conversations about possible opportunities and virtual networking events and chats. Join professional groups online on (Facebook and LinkedIn) to expand your search and network. Instead of blindly applying, focus your efforts on leveraging your network to source additional opportunities and keep track of your progress. During this downtime, it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to make new authentic connections and revive old ones.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>7. Search for companies that are launching virtual internship fairs.<\/b><\/p><p>Look out for companies that are launching virtual internship fairs and programs to help guide your internship search. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Job\/amrock-jobs-SRCH_KE0,6.htm?jobType=internship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amrock<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.synopsys.com\/company\/synopsys-careers\/Internships.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Synopsys<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Overview\/Working-at-HP-Inc-EI_IE1093161.11,17.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HP,<\/a> are offering virtual internships programs given COVID-19.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>8. Focus on gaining new soft and hard skills.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>During this pandemic, take some time to develop and enhance your soft and hard skills.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/4-soft-skills-to-develop-during-times-of-uncertainty\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Soft skills<\/a> are character traits, personal attributes, and other non-technical abilities that help you work and communicate with other people. Some soft skills you might have to study and learn, and others might come to you naturally.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/guide\/develop-soft-skills\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> \u00a0Listening, communication, and delegation<\/a> are all examples of soft skills. Add to your professional toolkit by expanding your hard skills. Use your free time to take online courses to develop your professional kit. It\u2019s essential to take advantage of the opportunity to bolster your qualifications by learning new skills. Having a few certifications under your belt will be helpful when applying for new roles. Given the current climate, several online learning companies have offered to share professional training and courses for free, like Coursera.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>9. Brush up on your virtual interviewing skills.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>Although the interviewer\u2019s questions are likely to be similar to ones posed in an in-person interview, there will be differences between interviewing in-person versus interviewing virtually. Trying to make a pitch about their career qualifications and sharing their brand narrative via video conferencing software, such as Skype, Zoom, or Google Hangouts, can feel a bit overwhelming, but learning how to interview virtually effectively is key to your search success.

Think about getting a virtual career coach.\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>Virtual career coaches can help you guide your search and fill in any blanks you might have about the direction you\u2019d like to go in career-wise. Career coaches cover resume and cover letter development, structuring your LinkedIn profile and online presence, all while helping you curate an internship search strategy.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>11. Be patient with slower processes.<\/b><\/p><p>Try to be patient with yourself and employers. This is a tough time for us all, and companies are experiencing challenges undergoing so much change in a short time. Recognize that processes will go slower than usual, given that companies are trying to adapt to our new normal.<\/p>","protected":false,"api_jobs_widget":{"job_title":"Intern","job_age":"7","limit":"10"}},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The coronavirus pandemic has dramatically affected the job economy as we know it, including internships.

Whatever the case, you are not alone. Many people who want to change careers get stuck along the way. Let\u2019s look at some of the most common obstacles career changers face, whether before or during their career transition, and how you can overcome each one of them.<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>1. Focusing on What You Lack <\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">This has to be mentioned right at the top \u2014 almost everyone I talk to who is thinking of changing careers but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/career-plateau\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feels stuck<\/a> is focusing on all the things they do <i>not<\/i> know how to do, or on all the resources they <i>don\u2019t<\/i> have. This is completely backward \u2014 no one hires you based on what you do not know or have. The only things that matter are what you <em>do<\/em> know, what you have already accomplished, and what you are interested in learning. Focus on what you can <i>already<\/i> contribute to any profession and you\u2019ll find yourself much more empowered in your career journey.<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>2. Not Knowing What You Want <\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">Do you feel confident you can get whatever you want... except you don\u2019t know what that is? If this sounds familiar when it comes to your career transition, dig deep: is it really true that you <i>don\u2019t know<\/i> what you want? In my experience most people know<i> what<\/i> they want, but might not know what<i> it looks like<\/i> in a job. For example, you might know you would be happy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/best-companies-working-from-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working from home<\/a> and writing, but you are not sure what kind of job would pay you to do just that. If this is you, stop saying you don\u2019t know what you want and instead address the real question, which is that you are not sure what career could give you what you want. Or it might be that you know what you want but are so afraid you wouldn\u2019t succeed that you don\u2019t let yourself <i>admit<\/i> that\u2019s what you want. In that case your issue is fear, not lack of clarity.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">If you <i>really<\/i> don\u2019t know what you want, take this moment in time as an opportunity to try anything that feels interesting. Have fun exploring, and you\u2019ll discover in the process what feels best. (Hint: you will not find the answer in your head \u2014 you need to get out and in action!)<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>3. Lack of Information<\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">In my work helping people change careers I often hear about different jobs... and sometimes encounter professions I didn\u2019t even know existed! The truth is that you were probably exposed to only a few possible career options while growing up, and don\u2019t know much about a wide variety of professions. Add the fact that technological innovation is creating many more opportunities that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/jobs-that-didnt-exist-15-years-ago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">didn\u2019t even exist just a few years ago<\/a>, and chances are there are at least a few options that could be a good match for you, but you\u2019ve never heard of. Most career changers don\u2019t have enough information to make an informed decision \u2014 this is why you need to research and test possible professions and business ideas to gain real knowledge of what they are <i>really<\/i> like before committing to a new career.<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>4. Money Worries<\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">We all know the drill: you should have at least 6 months of savings, no debt, a full-time job or at least a steady part-time income... in other words, you should be in a strong financial position before embarking on a career change. If you are, and you still feel <a href=\"https:\/\/www.repurposeyourpurpose.com\/jobs-that-pay-well-money-worries-changing-careers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stressed over money<\/a>, keep reading for more tips on how to overcome fear. Focus on doing the work, and as long as you keep your financial acumen you\u2019ll be fine.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">If you are one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/03\/15\/bankrate-65-percent-of-americans-save-little-or-nothing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">65 percent of Americans<\/a> without significant savings or one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/blog\/average-credit-card-debt-household\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">48 percent of Americans<\/a> who carry credit card debt or belong to the estimated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/07\/15\/629212924\/the-call-in-underemployment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">33 percent of college graduates<\/a> who are underemployed, this is for you: I get it. I know it\u2019s scary, and I know changing careers for you comes with added obstacles. Here\u2019s the deal, though \u2014 you can\u2019t afford more of the same exactly <i>because<\/i> it\u2019s not working financially. Feeling worried or anxious about your finances will not help you \u2014 in fact, it will probably make it harder for you to make good decisions. Only your actions matter: learn to negotiate, say No to extra work that is underpaid or, if you are unemployed, volunteer, and take on any type of work you are interested in rather than staying at home (it will also help you with your resume). If you are already working like crazy and still struggling, commit to just a few hours each week to dedicate to your career transition. Do not let the lack of money stop you \u2014 instead, use it as a powerful fire to light up your search for a new career. You can't afford to.<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>5. Unhealed Trauma<\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">I personally think this is the big elephant in the room \u2014 the one thing we don\u2019t talk about when discussing career-related issues. And we should. Our past, if not properly dealt with, can have an immense impact on how we relate to others. So how does unhealed trauma affect your career change? When you embark on any transition, including a career change, you are very likely to face rejection and failure \u2014 and these can be tough for everyone, but if you carry a lot of weight from the past, a negative experience can feel much worse once unhealed trauma is triggered. This is why it is so important to deal with your past. Treat <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/guide\/how-to-change-careers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your career change<\/a> as part of a wider process of healing and start working with a therapist or healing professional of your choice right away. Your deep healing will help you better weather the ups and downs of your career change and will expand your life beyond what you think is possible. Your desire to change careers could be part of a deeper calling to finally let go of what has been holding you back \u2014 so you can finally soar.<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>6. Lack of Role Models and Mentors<\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">Some of us are lucky enough to have knowledgeable and supportive family members, or maybe we had a cool teacher in the past or a boss who believed in us. Sometimes, though, that doesn\u2019t happen, or the people who cheer us have no knowledge of the field we want to enter. If that\u2019s the case, you need to go out and expand your network. This can mean finding someone who \u201cofficially\u201d becomes your mentor (check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/find-mentor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SCORE<\/a>) or meeting people who are further ahead in your chosen career and learning from them through your interactions, deep conversations, and rapport. I also recommend joining a group that is all about empowering its members. For example, there are many groups that support <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/how-to-get-more-women-in-stem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">women in technology<\/a>: by joining one, attending events, and networking, you can find a lot of helpful information and resources to help you enter a new field. And through those interactions, you might also end up meeting a wonderful mentor or role model in a more traditional sense of the word.<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>7. Analysis Paralysis<\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">This has got to be my favorite one, as I used to be a chronic sufferer from the condition! Some of us tend to get stuck trying to figure out <i>every single step<\/i> from now until we retire in our heads. And of course, as each step comes with imaginary catastrophes, a lack of real information and often fear, we never feel we can make a decision, let alone know enough to take action. Argh! \u00a0Here\u2019s the good news: this approach doesn\u2019t work. Once you realize that it\u2019s impossible to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/make-career-change-dream-reality\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plan your entire career change<\/a> <i>in your head<\/i>, you will finally give yourself permission to take one step at a time. What is the next thing you know you need to do in order to move forward? Focus on <i>that<\/i>. And trust that as you take that one step, you will be able to see the next, and then the next and so forth until you can reach your destination.<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>8. You Think the Past Is a Preview of What\u2019s to Come<\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">Just because every boss you had so far was unsupportive, it doesn\u2019t mean that your next boss will be; just because you have always made little money, it doesn\u2019t mean you will always be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/guide\/how-to-know-if-youre-underpaid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underpaid<\/a>. We don\u2019t know what the future has in store for us, but the good news is you can always work towards a different outcome. Bad bosses? I bet you can now spot the early signs! Underpaid? Use that as motivation to say 'No' to positions that pay too little and to move into a career or industry that pays what you need, learn to negotiate, update your skills, etc. Acknowledge what happened in the past, learn from it, and then focus on what you want moving forward. Give the future a chance!<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>9. Trying to fit in<\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">\u201cI should be more open, I should go to more networking events, I am too much of an introvert, people like me don\u2019t usually...\u201d Stop right there! I am all for self-improvement, but there is a difference between wanting to grow as a person and imagining everyone else is better than you. Chances are, you already have all if not most of what you need to succeed: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.repurposeyourpurpose.com\/stuck-because-big-picture-thinker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">embrace who you are<\/a>. Love yourself, focus on what you enjoy doing and are naturally good at, have fun learning new skills and getting out of your comfort zone, but do not think you need to be like someone else in order to be fulfilled in your career. You will be able to live a fulfilled life, including in your career, when you accept yourself as you are. From that place, you will become more open to new opportunities, flexible on the things you can be flexible about and someone people will want to be around. Trust me: Once you stop trying to fit in, you will find a career that is a good fit for you.<\/p><h3 class=\"p1\"><b>10. Don\u2019t Make It All About Yourself<\/b><\/h3><p class=\"p1\">Last, but not least, it\u2019s not just about you. In fact, the more you make it about you, the more insecure and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/manage-stress-at-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stressed<\/a> you will feel. Who do you want to serve? What lights you up? What difference do you want to make? These questions don\u2019t have to have world-changing answers to motivate you: You can choose a career to provide your family with a stable environment, or you can commit to creating a business that offers employees great health insurance from day one because you believe in providing such benefits.

As the coronavirus pandemic stretches from weeks into months, it\u2019s reshaping the U.S.\u00a0 job market at lightning speed. For perspective, the U.S. is on track to lose as many job openings on a percentage basis in the first four weeks of the crisis as we did in the first nine months of the Great Recession.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the bright side, data from Glassdoor\u2019s economic team shows an increased availability of remote jobs. While economic headwinds are overwhelming short-term growth, with remote jobs declining 10.8 percent in the last month, they are still up 8.7 percent year over year. Additionally, the share of jobs listed as remote is increasing sharply, up 27.9 percent from last year. This data proves to those who have wondered if the current crisis will bring about a sea change in remote work may be correct, which shows that some companies are still actively hiring.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, many job seekers, college graduates included are naturally wondering, is it even worth it to apply for a job right now? Our career expert, Allison Sullivan, recently spoke to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketplace.org\/2020\/04\/20\/is-it-worth-applying-for-a-job-right-now\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marketplace<\/a> about the importance of still applying for jobs, how to address COVID-19 in interviews, and how to network while social distancing. See her responses below.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Is anyone hiring? Is it even worth applying for a job right now?<\/strong><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, there are opportunities out there for those on the job hunt, and it is still worthwhile to stick to your search. You may have to adjust aspects of your job search as things change during the coronavirus outbreak. For instance, the types of opportunities and abundance of them will look different, depending on the industry Now is a valuable time to do your research. Identify the sectors and companies currently hiring and what transferable skills you can market to shift into open opportunities. Your application materials should be customized to the opportunity, and proofread to stand out from other applicants. Also, don\u2019t forget to tap into or build your network. Even if you haven\u2019t found the right job, signaling you\u2019re looking can help you find opportunities in the future.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>I am not laid off or furloughed, but I don't like my job. Should I use this time at home to look for other jobs?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you feel ready for a new job, it never hurts to be on the lookout. There are employers still in need of talent, and so this extended time at home can be a way to reflect on career goals, research potential opportunities, and understand who is hiring. Because today\u2019s hiring landscape is shifting, if you do have a job, stay in your current role while you\u2019re job searching for potential other opportunities.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>There is this tweet going around about a hypothetical future job interview and the candidate asking the company about what precautions they took to protect their workers and how they handled the COVID-19 situation. Is that a good question to ask in future job interviews?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">For years, we\u2019ve seen that many employees and job seekers want to work for companies that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/research\/employee-satisfaction-drivers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prioritize<\/a> culture and the quality of its leaders. Actions in a time of crisis can speak volumes. Companies should be prepared for this question or expect that candidates have done their research on how a company responded to the COVID-19 outbreak.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you network while social distancing?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to technology, there are still avenues to network and expand your professional network while hunkered down at home. Many professional organizations offer virtual events or happy hours, which can help you connect with peers and fine-tune your video communication skills. Plus, there are plenty of ways to meet and make new career connections via professional networking platforms. A new professional acquaintance may be more open to email correspondences or a virtual coffee or drink during a time when many are craving social interaction and have a more open calendar.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><\/a><\/p>","protected":false,"api_jobs_widget":{"job_age":"7","limit":"10"}},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Last week, another 5.2 million Americans filed for unemployment \u2014 about 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the previous four&#8230;","protected":false},"author":567,"featured_media":50203,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1163,1168],"tags":[449,3286,359,107,2166,546],"yst_prominent_words":[],"featured_image_url":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/app\/uploads\/sites\/2\/COVID-19-Landing-Page-Resource-workingparents-561x320.png","render_native":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50289"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/567"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=50289"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50289\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":50291,"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50289\/revisions\/50291"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/50203"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=50289"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=50289"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=50289"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=50289"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
